Kiddos XP, also known as Kiddies XP, Is the upcoming project utilising Augemented Reality to interactively teach children in the foundational level the basics of their surroundings in a fun-filled way.

- Children have always been ones to be highly inqusitive, especially during the ages of 2 and 6. In a generation that is dominated with technological innovations, children should also be included in this movement.
- Building upon this, an effective learning platform integrating strategic learning methods as well as Augmented reality, a very useful program can be created, which is 
essentially the crux of our AR program.
- We therefore present the application Kiddos XP, a program which allows children to learn more of their surroundings as well as basics such as mathematics and geometry, at a ridiculously friendly and basic way for children to understand and enjoy.
- The application has been specially created with the 
# Getting Started

***Grassroots learning***

Grassroots learning is aimed in pro. Learning from the ground level. This is good for children at the age of 3 - 4 years old.

***Numbers, shapes and colours***

The environment all around us, for example buildings, are comprised of complex shapes which can be broken down into simple shapes. This section of this AR experience will allow children to be able to enjoy the environment as well as learn of the shapes that are therein. This may serve as a good learning experience for kids to be more acquinted with geometry.
