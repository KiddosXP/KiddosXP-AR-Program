Kiddos XP Is the upcoming project utilising Augemented Reality to interactively teach children in the foundational level the basics of their surroundings.

- Children have always been ones to be highly inqusitive, especially during the ages of 2 and 6. In a generation that is dominated with technological innovations, children should also be included in this movement.
- Building upon this, an effective learning platform integrating strategic learning methods as well as Augmented reality, a very useful program can be created, which is 
essentially the crux of our AR program.
- We therefore present the application Kiddos EX, a program which allows children to learn more of their surroundings as well as basics such as mathematics and geometry, at a ridiculously friendly and basic way for children to understand and enjoy.
